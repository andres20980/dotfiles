## Educational Use Notice

This project is specifically designed for educational purposes to teach GitOps 
concepts and best practices. While the patterns and architectures implemented 
here are production-ready, please review and adapt security configurations 
before using in production environments.

The default credentials (admin/admin123) and configurations are intentionally 
simple for learning purposes and should be changed in any non-educational use.
